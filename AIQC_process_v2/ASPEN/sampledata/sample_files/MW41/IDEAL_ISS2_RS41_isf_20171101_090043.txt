    Comments                                     	20 cu. ft., clear and calm, operator: Isabel. Launch detect may have been bad, I heard the launch detect noise as I was still filling the balloon but when I got back to the computer after the launch it was showing the sonde as not launched. About 9:02 it recognized 9:00 as the launch time, which I think is the correct time but I'm not sure.
